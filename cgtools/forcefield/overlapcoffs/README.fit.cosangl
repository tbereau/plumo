fit the functions as the sum of the Gaussian functions by Zunjing Wang, July 1st 2008 
Notice, the Gaussian has a ratio PI according to my dataset

parameter sequence in fitcoff.cosadf.*.dat 
N: number of Gaussian funcitons
a_i, b_i, c_i

y = sum_(i=1,...,N) a_i*exp[-(x -b_i)^2 / (2 * c_i^2)]
x (i.e. cos(theta)): [-1, 1]
# the Gaussian is a*exp[-(x-b)^2 / (2.0 * c^2)], thus c_i = sqrt(2)* c

Pot (x) = -kBT * ln (y)
