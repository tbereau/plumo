PROGRAM :
=========

Protein aggregation analysis script. ragtime relies on the STRIDE algorithm to
extract secondary structure of amino acids. It parses the results, and
provides further analysis for statistics over many snapshots and protein chains.

ragtime has several features :
	o  aggregation percentage
	o  helicity percentage
	o  length of the longest helix (only for single PDB analysis)
	o  number of helices (only for single PDB analysis)
	o  ratio of antiparallel (A), parallel (P), mixed (M), and helical (H)
	   conformations 
	o  counts of n-aggregates with arbitrary n
	o  types of 2-aggregates (A;P)
	o  types of 3-aggregates (A;P;M)
	o  counts of A/P/M/E/H conformations for each amino acid, given that all
	   protein chains are identical (E stands for extended, where the
	   algorithm wasn't able to determine between A or P)
	o  cluster algorithm based on hydrogen bonding



GETTING STARTED :
=================

System Requirements :
Script language     : tcl 8.4 or higher (never been tested on earlier versions,
					  it may work...)
Additional software : STRIDE <http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/stride/>



INSTALLATION :
==============

ragtime doesn't have to be compiled, it's Tcl. Make sure ragtime.tcl has execution
permissions :
	> chmod +x ragtime.tcl
ragtime_functions.tcl needs either to be in the current directory, or added to
the PATH environment variable.

One needs STRIDE defined in the PATH environment variable to run. Download the
tarball from the abovementioned STRIDE website, and untar. If your
version of STRIDE was downloaded after Nov. 17, 2008, just compile (see
below). Otherwise, you will need to fix by hand a small bug : 

In 'report.c', line 254(?)

          p->Acc->Chain->Rsd[Res]->ResType,SpaceToDash(Chain[Cn]->Id),

should be replaced by

          p->Acc->Chain->Rsd[Res]->ResType,SpaceToDash(p->Acc->Chain->Id),

Likewise, line 272(?)

          p->Dnr->Chain->Rsd[Res]->ResType,SpaceToDash(Chain[Cn]->Id),

becomes 

          p->Dnr->Chain->Rsd[Res]->ResType,SpaceToDash(p->Dnr->Chain->Id),


Then compile by typing

	 > make

and make sure the output is added to your $PATH environment variable.
If STRIDE cannot be found by ragtime, the script will exit.



QUICK START :
=============

The script reads snapshots in the form of PDB files. At least one pdb file
needs to be fed in the program, the maximum number of files is limited by the
operating system's capacity.

	> ragtime.tcl [OPTIONS] file...

where OPTIONS can be :
           -a           Only display aggregation related conformations
		   -c			Cluster algorithm
           -e           Only display helix conformations
		   -f			stride error messages will be ignored
           -h           Display this usage message
           -s           Statistics on residues (only for identical chains)
		   -y           Calculates hydrogen-bond energy
           -v           Verbose mode

The help message can also be accessed via

	> ragtime.tcl --help

The -a and -e options are only useful when displaying information with respect
to each amino acid. These options can be combined with
-v. In such cases, the output will display :
	o  part of the STRIDE output (in which conformation is each residue)
	o  an array of residue conformation, using the ragtime letter scheme
	   (A/P/M/E/H) storing every snapshot
	o  Aggregation analysis (statistics for all residues/snapshots)
	o  Helicity analysis (statistics for all residues/snapshots)

The -c option will make statistics based on hydrogen bonds between
peptides. It will determine the distribution of clusters and bin them.

The -s option counts which letter codes have been assigned to each
residue. This is especially useful when interested in e.g. which residues most
strongly aggregate, or form alpha-helices. This allow for statistics on each
residue using all snapshots.

The -y option will calculate hydrogen-bond energy as in eqn 8 of paper:
